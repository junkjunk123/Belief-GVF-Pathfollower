This is a proof-of-concept for a Guiding Vector Field on belief space, under a generalized Riemannian Manifold workspace. We represent the vector field by the Wasserstein gradient descent flows of variational free energy, using both a localization and path-following prior to prioritize avoiding occluded areas of the workspace. The goal of this vector field is to bridge the theories of guiding vector fields with control-as-inference.
